## IAM

- Users.

- Groups.

- Roles.

- Policies to the previous elements. Policies in groups inherit by the users in the group. Are defined using JSON.

- IAM is universal.

- The root account is simple the account created when first setup the AWS account.

- New users have NO permissions when first created.

- New users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Key when first created. These are not the same as passwords.

- You only get the view to the access key once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate.

- Always setup multifactor Authentication on the root account.

- You can create and customise password rotation policies.
